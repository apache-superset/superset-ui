  /**
   * The control panel is split into two tabs: "Query" and 
   * "Chart Options". The controls that define the inputs to 
   * the chart data request, such as columns and metrics, usually
   * reside within "Query", while controls that affect the visual
   * appearance or functionality of the chart are under the 
   * "Chart Options" section.
   *
   * There are several predefined controls that can be used.
   * Some examples:
   * - groupby: columns to group by (tranlated to GROUP BY statement)
   * - series: same as groupby, but single selection.
   * - metrics: multiple metrics (translated to aggregate expression)
   * - metric: sane as metrics, but single selection
   * - adhoc_filters: filters (translated to WHERE or HAVING
   *   depending on filter type)
   * - row_limit: maximum number of rows (translated to LIMIT statement)
   *
   * If a control panel has both a `series` and `groupby` control, and
   * the user has chosen `col1` as the value for the `series` control, 
   * and `col2` and `col3` as values for the `groupby` control,
   * the resulting query will contain three groupby columns. This is due 
   * to the `series` control having the property `queryField` set to
   * `groupby`, which automatically appends the values from the 
   * `series` control to the `groupby` control when the query is generated.
   *
   * It is also possible to define custom controls by importing the 
   * necessary dependencies and overriding the default parameters, which
   * can then be placed in the `controlSetRows` section
   * of the `Query` section instead of a predefined control.
   *
   * import { validateNonEmpty } from '@superset-ui/validator';
   * import { internalSharedControls } from '@superset-ui/control-utils';
   *
   * const myControl = {
   *   name: 'secondary_entity',
   *   config: {
   *     ...internalSharedControls.controls.entity,
   *     type: 'SelectControl',
   *     label: t('Secondary Entity'),
   *     mapStateToProps: state => ({
   *       internalSharedControls.columnChoices(state.datasource)
   *       .columns.filter(c => c.groupby)
   *     })
   *     validators: [validateNonEmpty],
   *   },
   * }
   *
   * This would create a new control called `secondary_entity`, which is 
   * based on the standard `entity` control and only offers columns that are 
   * defined as groupable in the table metadata,
   * and requires the control to not be empty prior to execution.
   *
   * In addition to the basic drop down control, there are several predefined
   * control types (can be set via the `type` property) that can be used. Some 
   * commonly used examples:
   * - SelectControl: Dropdown to select single or multiple values,
       usually columns
   * - MetricsControl: Dropdown to select metrics, triggering a modal
       to define Metric details
   * - AdhocFilterControl: Control to choose filters
   * - CheckboxControl: A checkbox for choosing true/false values
   * - SliderControl: A slider with min/max values
   * - TextControl: Control for text data
   *
   * To ensure all controls have been filled out correctly, the following
   * validators are provided
   * by the `@superset-ui/validator` package:
   * - validateNonEmpty: must have at least one value
   * - validateInteger: must be an integer value
   * - validateNumber: must be an intger or decimal value
